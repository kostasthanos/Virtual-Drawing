# Virtual-Drawing-OpenCV
Virtual Drawing with color detection using Python and OpenCV library.

For a full presentation of the working project watch the [video]() in Youtube.

## Main Idea
The main idea of this project is to allow user to draw anything "virtualy" on screen with the help of a web camera.

### [1] Two project windows
The first window (_Frame_), which is also the main one, shows what the camera "sees" with the addition of shapes (rectangles) in order to define regions of interests which from which basic functions are being performed. The second one (_Canvas_) with a black background shows only user's drawing. 

### [2] Color settings and color detection


### [3] Maximum contour and center

### [4] Drawing and save

More details about the code are being exlpained as comments inside the file [virtual_drawing.py](https://github.com/kostasthanos/Virtual-Drawing-OpenCV/blob/main/virtual_drawing.py)
